# calculator-console-app
A simple calculator application built using C++ and CMake. The purpose of this project was to explore various C++ libraries and headers such as Windows.h and to learn how to build and debug console applications using Visual Studio.


### Getting Started
The first step is to clone the repository on your machine.
> git clone https://github.com/VibhorAgrawal2003/calculator-console-app.git

After cloning process is complete, to run the application, execute the following file. 
> ./Debug/ConApp1.exe

To build the application and tinker around with it, you need an integrated development environment (IDE). While almost any modern IDE would suffice, this application was built using Visual Studio. A beginner may benefit from installing Visual Studio on their system with the necessary C++ configuration for building cross-platform applications. Once installed, simply clone the repository and run the "ConApp1.sln" solution file. You can run the last build or create a new build using the Visual Studio build option. To make changes, refer to the directory structure provided by Visual Studio.


### Source Files
The application has a bunch of files in it but the main files you can tinker around with are as follows:
- Main.cpp : Application source code file
- Main.h : Header file for Main.cpp
- Handle.cpp : Functions for console application
- Handle.h : Header file for Handle.cpp
- Colors.h : Variables for console colors
